# Automated-Realtime-Robotic-Arm
This industrial robotic arm will pick different types of objects (only color in this project) classify them with the help of computer vision and then put them in the required box. This whole process will run in real-time. That means the robotic arm will start its process whenever it finds any object.
Details are discussed in this YouTube video, https://youtu.be/KeyEe2Tt25Q
